        <h1>butterflies</h1>
        <p>in my stomach again
        <BR>bouncing against the
        <BR>acid-lined walls</p>

        <p>it burns--I can't tell
        <BR>if it's from heat or ice
        <BR>or poison.</p>

        <p>you put them there,
        <BR>brought them home
        <BR>one day,
        <BR>a gift for me</p>

        <p>for me.</p>

        <p>imploding or exploding--
        <BR>I can't tell.</p>

        <p>I do love the way
        <BR>they look in the morning,
        <BR>butterflies in my garden,
        <BR>dancing on the wind,
        <BR>flirting with the bees...</p>

        <p>but at night they are moths
        <BR>drawn mindlessly
        <BR>to fabricated light
        <BR>and I can't look at them</p>

        <p>because I remember you
        <BR>and then they're back
        <BR>in my stomach.</p>

        <p>don't get me wrong,
        <BR>they're beautiful,
        <BR>and I love them.
        <BR>I want them, I am them.
        <BR>I too can be carried off
        <BR>by the wind.
        <BR>I too would like to
        <BR>drown in flowers.
        <BR>I too don my colors proudly.</p>

        <p>and then there was you.
        <BR>now I have a reason
        <BR>for the colors and faces
        <BR>on my wings.</p>

        <p>chaos theory says
        <BR>a flap of a butterfly's wing
        <BR>can cause a hurricane.
        <BR>so here I am
        <BR>â€‹braving your storm.</p>
