  	<h1>What is ASAE?</h1>
  	<p>
  		We spend each year designing, manufacturing, testing, and flying aircraft in preparation for the SAE International Aero-Design West competition each Spring. The rules of the competition teach our team to optimize our engineering and design abilities in a payload optimization and humanitarian themed environment against other Universities from around the world.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Sponsored by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), the competition tests our design, organizational, and engineering abilities at a far greater magnitude than what we learn in the classroom. At the competition we are scored in several categories: design, presentation, maximum payload, and flight skill.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  	</p>
  	<h1>What will you gain?</h1>
  	<p>
  		The beauty of Aero SAE is the quantity and quality of experience you acquire from working outside of the classroom. Everything we do is hands-on and applicable to the aerospace industry. If you want to work with laser-cutters, improve your SolidWorks skills, or spend more time with electronics, we will facilitate that. Additionally, we are confident the skills you bring to the table will equivalently help the team develop better aircraft.
