      <h1>ASAE</h1>
      <p><b>Mentor, Empennage Lead, Webmaster</b> | Fall 2015 - Fall 2017</p>
      <p>The Aerospace Society of Automative Engineers (ASAE) design competition is a college-level engineering competition where students design and build remote control model airplanes to achieve certain tasks. As part of the UC Berkeley team, I participated in the regular class, where we were tasked with making a plane that can carry as much weight as possible while still fly. I am involved with the empennage team, in which I helped design, CAD, perform engineering analyses on, and manufacture the empennage as well as collaborated with other subteams to create the final product. As the organization's internal affairs officer, I also designed and built the team <a href="http://calasae.github.io" target="_blank">website</a>, handled recruitment, and planned team events such as the beginning-of-the-year mini-competition for new members and bonding activities.</p>
      <p>You can learn more about my work on ASAE on the <a href="projects.html/#bearworks" target="_blank">projects page</a>.</p>
