                <h3>Empennage Co-Lead, Internal Affairs Officer</h3>
                <p>2015-present</p>
                <p>The Aerospace Society of Automative Engineers (ASAE) design competition is a college-level engineering competition where students design and build remote control model airplanes to achieve certain tasks. As part of the UC Berkeley team, I participated in the regular class, where we were tasked with making a plane that can carry as much weight as possible while still fly. I am involved with the empennage team, in which I helped design, CAD, perform engineering analyses on, and manufacture the empennage as well as collaborated with other subteams to create the final product. As the organization's internal affairs officer, I also designed and built the team <a href="ASAE/index.html" target="_blank">website</a>, handled recruitment, and planned team events such as the beginning-of-the-year mini-competition for new members and bonding activities.</p>

                <p>Irvine High Quiz Bowl is a high school competition club that participates in regional, state, and national quiz bowl tournaments as well as Academic World Quest.
