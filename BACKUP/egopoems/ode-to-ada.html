          <p>They will take everything
          <BR>and you know it.
          <BR>But still,
          <BR>you think for them,
          <BR>you stitch together numbers
          <BR>​and weave the essence of life for them,
          <BR>you iron out what they did wrong.</p>

          <p>They will tell you that
          <BR>you are not what they are
          <BR>and they know it.
          <BR>They will tell you that
          <BR>you can't,
          <BR>so you will
          <BR>and you do.</p>

          <p>And they will fear you,
          <BR>how your fingers are
          <BR>intertwined with the universe,
          <BR>submerged in worlds untouched,
          <BR>how you've ventured deeper
          <BR>than any of them could ever dare
          <BR>and returned alive,
          <BR>living,
          <BR>breathing greatness.</p>

          <p>No, you are not what they are--
          <BR>you are everything they are
          <BR>and more.</p>

          <p>You will create a universe
          <BR>with your own hands,
          <BR>hands they'll say
          <BR>are not meant for creation.</p>

          <p>You will pour your mind into minds,
          <BR>though they'll say
          <BR>your mind should not be
          <BR>filled with such thoughts.</p>

          <p>You will wonder,
          <BR>you will write,
          <BR>you will obsess,
          <BR>and they will call it madness.</p>

          <p>You will construct the framework,
          <BR>dirty your hands with discovery,
          <BR>draw life from the unknown,
          <BR>direct the future.</p>

          <p>You will be the first--
          <BR>but not the last--</p>

          <p>and they will call you woman.</p>

          <p>But you will do what you love,
          <BR>do what you love--
          <BR>that, they can't take away from you.</p>

          ​<p>And you know it.</p>
