        <h1>Ordinary People</h1>
        <span style="position: relative; text-align: left; left: 7vw;">
          <p align="left">What am I supposed to love in you?
          <BR>Your beauty? Your eyes?
          <BR>Your smile and white teeth?
          <BR>The way you think
          <BR>or the way you feel?
          <BR>Or your genetic code?</p>

          <p align="left">How do ordinary people fall in love,
          <BR>ordinary people like us?
          <BR>I am you
          <BR>and you are me
          <BR>at the core,
          <BR>or did we just merge
          <BR>when we collided?</p>

          <p align="left">We speak and breathe like the rest of them.
          <BR>We walk and think and yearn
          <BR>all the same.
          <BR>We live very humanly.</p>

          <p align="left">We can say we love our quirks,
          <BR>the tiny things we do,
          <BR>anything that isn't clockwork.</p>

          <p align="left">We can say it was love at first sight.</p>

          <p align="left">We can say we just knew.</p>

          <p align="left">Perhaps we were just meant for each other.
          <BR>Made for each other.
          <BR>Tailored very carefully,
          <BR>magnetic strips sewn into our backs
          <BR>so we'd just know when the time came,
          <BR>if the time came.</p>

          <p align="left">Whatever it is,
          <BR>it helps a lot,
          <BR>because the only way I can tell you apart
          <BR>is your DNA,
          <BR>but that is not why I love you,
          <BR>and I don't know how.</p>

          <p align="left">I love you but I'm not in love.</p>

          <p align="left">Something tells me our paths
          <BR>weren't meant to cross.
          <BR>Made for each other
          <BR>but not to meet.
          <BR>Roads paved and hearts engraved
          <BR>for display, not for play.</p>

          <p align="left">It's a shame:
          <BR>some people wonder if anyone will love them.
          <BR>I wonder if I'll ever be in love.</p>

          <BR>
