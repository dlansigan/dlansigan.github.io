        <h1>Dead Man</h1>
        <span style="position: relative; text-align: left; left: 10vw;">
          <p>The building blared and
          <BR>screamed fire into
          <BR>the early Sunday morning,
          <BR>the part of morning that is
          <BR>still considered
          <BR>night. It screamed at
          <BR>nothing and we groaned
          <BR>at nothing as we
          <BR>completed our
          <BR>exodus reluctantly.</p>

          <p>Then we found him there,
          <BR>a blue tie loose around his
          <BR>neck like a badly made
          <BR>hangman's noose,
          <BR>browned white shirt,
          <BR>dusty dress pants.
          <BR>There was something poetic about
          <BR>the way he lay there--
          <BR>perfectly and peacefully,
          <BR>straight from head to toe,
          <BR>arms at the side,
          <BR>like a dead man,
          <BR>a casualty in a skirmish.
          <BR>And he continued to lay there
          <BR>dead-like,
          <BR>on the concrete stairs,
          <BR>his head in the bushes,
          <BR>wet leaves up to his eyes,
          <BR>while two of us touched his wrists
          <BR>in search of life.
          <BR>The rest of us stared
          <BR>and wondered
          <BR>if this was the fire.</p>

          <p>But he moved,
          <BR>shook his head under the leaves,
          <BR>and that was enough
          <BR>to let us know
          <BR>he only looked dead.
          <BR>So they carried him away
          <BR>in his perfect form,
          <BR>the noose still around his neck.</p>
