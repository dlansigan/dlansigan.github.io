										<p>Hello! My name is Dana. I am a second-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and I hope to enter a career in aerospace.</p>
										<p>Growing up, I loved making things. Legos, cardboard boxes, used toilet paper rolls&mdash;whatever I could get my hands on, I'd transform them into something else. Things I couldn't build I'd draw or write about. I still do creative writing now: in my free time, I enjoy writing short stories and poems as well as songs to play on my ukulele and guitar.</p>
										<p>Then when I was about 12, I discovered that by typing combinations of characters into the Neopets profile editor, I could make my profile look a certain way. My parents, who are both programmers, later notified me that this was called HTML. I loved this new thing called programming I had discovered and I later picked up more languages.</p>
										<p>On my way to my Mechanical Engineering degree, I'm still building, and I'm excited to continue creating!</p>

											<h3>2015-present</h3>
											<p>The Aerospace Society of Automative Engineers (ASAE) design competition is a college-level engineering competition where students design and build remote control model airplanes to achieve certain tasks. As part of the UC Berkeley team, I participated in the regular class, where we were tasked with making a plane that can carry as much weight as possible while still fly. I am involved with the empennage team, in which I helped design, CAD, perform engineering analyses on, and manufacture the empennage as well as collaborated with other subteams to create the final product. As the organization's internal affairs officer, I also designed and built the team <a href="ASAE/index.html" target="_blank">website</a>, handled recruitment, and planned team events such as the beginning-of-the-year mini-competition for new members and bonding activities.</p>

											<h2>E 25 Design Project</h2>
											<p>Orthoslap is a die and cards matching game designed to introduce engineering students to the concepts of orthographic projection and multiview engineering drawings. The game aims to strengthen 3D visualization skills while also encouraging interaction and communication between peers.</p>
											<p>Each set of Orthoslap consists of one 2x2x2 inch master die, 6 sets of 6 cards corresponding to each face of the die, and 6 mini dice for each player to aid visualization. Gameplay consists of each player "slapping" down the correct top view to each roll of the master die. The dice were modeled using SolidWorks and AutoCad and manufactured with a 3D printer. The cards were drawn with AutoCad and designed with Photoshop.</p>
