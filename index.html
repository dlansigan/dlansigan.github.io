          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            I am a 4th year undergraduate Mechanical Engineering student at the University of California, Berkeley.
            I hope to enter a career in aerospace, preferrably in research and development.
            In order to reach this goal, I aim to earn a Ph. D. in Mechanical Engineering studying fluids.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifically, my research interests are in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and machine learning.
            I am currently an undergraduate researcher in <a href="https://cfd.me.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Philip Marcus's CFD Lab</a>, where I am working on aerodynamic shape optimization using deep learning.
            I hope to continue similar research in graduate school.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also had experience in industry.
            The summer of my sophomore year, I interned at <a href="" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> as an Explorer Intern, which is a program management and software development rotation internship.
            The summer of my senior year, I interned at <a href="" target="_blank">The Aerospace Corporation</a> as a Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) Intern.
            As part of the CAE team, I designed and built 3D printed models and developed software tools for other engineers in the company.
            More details about my internship experiences are in my <a href="assets/docs/dlansigan-CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.
